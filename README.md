# Travel Agent CBR Project
**CBR Independent Study 2023**

*Fall 2023 â€“ Milton Hinnant II advised by Larry Gates, David Leake*

Welcome to the Travel Agent Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) Project! Over the past thirteen weeks, under the guidance of advisors Larry Gates and David Leake, I delved into the fascinating realm of case-based reasoning. This journey was marked by challenges turned into valuable learning experiences, revealing the dynamic nature of AI and its adaptability.

## 1. Introduction
In this project, I explored case-based reasoning as a method for generating recommendations based on historical data. Contrary to initial assumptions, CBR proved to be versatile, adaptable to various scenarios, as exemplified by real-world applications like Google Maps and customer service chatbots.

## 2. Customer Support - CBR
The Customer Support CBR system focuses on troubleshooting steps generated from a help-desk dataset. With a flexible design, it accommodates diverse inputs, identifying and presenting top matching records based on attributes like 'DeviceType,' 'OperatingSystem,' 'DeviceAge,' 'ModelNumber,' and 'IssueDetails.' The weighting process and similarity metric ensure nuanced and accurate recommendations, emphasizing adaptability through dataset updates.

## 3. Travel Agent - CBR
Developing the Travel Agent CBR posed challenges, from parsing data to handling user input and calculating similarities. The system evaluates attributes such as recreation, number of persons, region, transportation, duration, season, and accommodation, applying customized weights and distance metrics. An adaptation feature empowers users to tailor their travel packages, overcoming challenges in price recalculation.

## 4. Conclusion
The Travel Agent CBR project highlighted the flexibility and effectiveness of case-based reasoning. The journey revealed its adaptability and specific solutions derived from past experiences. Examples like Google Maps and customer support chatbots showcase its versatility, surpassing initial expectations.
